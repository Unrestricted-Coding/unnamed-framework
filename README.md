# Un-Named Framework
A front-end web framework with no name yet. I'll think of a name as it becomes more developed.

## Goal

To create a web framework for front end development. This must be really small.

*Size Goal:* CSS < 50kb

*Size Goal:* JS < 50kb

We want things to truely cascade and be smart. No need for bloated css file to add new elements etc. Use what is already there to create new elements. Just provide examples on how to make them.

We want to create a javascript framework similar to jQuery but only uses most commonly used functions of jQuery and keeps it small..

## Inspiration:

My inspiration for this came from [RiotJS](http://riotjs.com/) and seeing how small their javascript library was. I wondered how much bloat I was putting into my applications by using standards such as Bootstrap or Semantic-UI. Yes they are pretty, and yes they are easy. But I'm going to use this framework to eliminate bloat from my projects.

## Features:

* Grid
* Styled Basic Elements
* Library system
  * Search examples to see how to build objects
